4. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

5. Contributions must be placed in the appropriate category-specific folder.

6. Your code contributions should have a proper name if you're creating a new file. For example:

   Let's say you're contributing to the Data Structures & Algorithms folder by solving a [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) problem, named Two Sum. Your file name should be two-sum followed by the appropriate extension of the language you're writing the code in.

   If you want to submit an entire project, let's say you're contributing a ToDo List app to the Web Development folder. Your folder name should be ToDo list, and all the files relating to the same should be within that folder.

7. Avoid submitting duplicate contributions. Check the existing codebase and issues before making a contribution. Feel free to add alternative language solutions to already existing solutions but with the same name, just a different extension.

8. Be polite and respectful when communicating with other contributors.

9. Your Pull Requests must be approved by maintainers before merging.
