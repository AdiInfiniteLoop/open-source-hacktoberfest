# OWASP NIE Student Chapter - Open Source Hacktoberfest

Welcome to the OWASP NIE Student Chapter's Open Source Hacktoberfest repository! We are excited to have you as part of our community, where you can contribute to open-source projects and enhance your coding skills. This repository is designed to encourage students to collaborate and share their code with the world while participating in Hacktoberfest.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software. It encourages contributions to open-source projects and provides an opportunity for developers to engage with the global open-source community.

## How to Contribute

   ```

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your contributions. The branch name should be your own name in full, following kebab-casing. For example, Arnav Bhattacharya would make a branch named arnav-bhattacharya

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Contribute Code**: Add your code to the appropriate category-specific folder within the repository. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's rules and regulations (see below).

5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your code changes with a clear and concise message.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added feature/fix for XYZ"
   ```

6. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/owasp-nie/open-source-hacktoberfest/) and click on "New Pull Request." Follow the instructions to submit your contribution.

8. **Add your details to contributors.json**: Add your details in the specified format to contributors.json once one of your PRs get merged. At the end of Hacktoberfest, we will update the readme.md with your photo, name and github ID, so that you can flex that you participated in Hacktoberfest 2023.

## Rules and Regulations

To maintain a positive and collaborative environment, please adhere to the following rules and regulations when contributing to this repository:

1. Go through the Hacktoberfest website for any doubts [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

2. Respect the [Hacktoberfest Code of Conduct](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/code-of-conduct).

3. Only submit high-quality code that you have written yourself.

4. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

5. Contributions must be placed in the appropriate category-specific folder.

6. Your code contributions should have a proper name if you're creating a new file. For example:

   Let's say you're contributing to the Data Structures & Algorithms folder by solving a [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) problem, named Two Sum. Your file name should be two-sum followed by the appropriate extension of the language you're writing the code in.

   If you want to submit an entire project, let's say you're contributing a ToDo List app to the Web Development folder. Your folder name should be ToDo list, and all the files relating to the same should be within that folder.

7. Avoid submitting duplicate contributions. Check the existing codebase and issues before making a contribution. Feel free to add alternative language solutions to already existing solutions but with the same name, just a different extension.

8. Be polite and respectful when communicating with other contributors.

9. Your Pull Requests must be approved by maintainers before merging.
